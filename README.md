# pive
The "pive" package provides estimates for causal models using many (weak) invalid instruments and heteroscedasticity. This package uses six instrumental variables methods to robustly estimate causal effects. Additionally, it conducts bootstrap sampling to derive estimates, standard errors, and confidence intervals.
